# Mobile Flashcards

## Description

Struggling to revise for your next big exam? Need a fun way to make sure you're ready?
Checkout the Mobile Flashcards app for creating revision flashcards. Keep all the
important questions together for each subject and quiz yourself on how strong you are
on it. Needless to say, you'll be acing the next exam you sit!


## Task

This app was the result of the 3rd and final project in Udacity's React Nanodegree. The
task was to create a Mobile Flashcards app using React Native, using the best practices
in React, Redux and React Native.


## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/).
It sets up the folder structure and build process, leaving the developer to focus on the
code. Expo makes it very easy to set up and run locally. You simply need to clone the
project and run two commands. Let Expo do the rest.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```


## Backend

The app has no backend but uses React Native's
[AsyncStorage](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/react-native/asyncstorage/) to mock
it. On first load, the AsyncStorage store is seeded with dummy data.
